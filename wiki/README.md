## Quick Start

```bash

cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Key Concepts

- **Tenant**: An isolated organizational unit (e.g., a coaching institute). Each tenant has its own students, quizzes, content, and analytics.
- **X-Tenant-ID**: A required HTTP header on all API requests that identifies which tenant the request belongs to.
- **VITE_TENANT_ID**: Frontend environment variable that controls which tenant the deployed frontend instance serves.
